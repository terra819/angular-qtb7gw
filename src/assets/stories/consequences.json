Alyssa and James were discussing their latest psych assignment when they noticed a slight rumbling in the distance. They both directed their attention toward the cafe's large windows and noticed a small but growing cloud of dust coming down main street, headed in their direction. James stood up from the booth and squinted at the sight. He walked toward the door and opened it. He and Alyssa stood on the sidewalk in front of the cafe as the foggy visitor lurched closer. </br>&quot;What is that?&quot; asked Alyssa. &quot;I don't kno----AAAH!&quot; -James stumbled over a large crack in the sidewalk and fell headfirst into the wriggling, opaque mass. &quot;I'll get help, I'll be right back&quot; Alyssa shouted at the ball now floating where James would have landed.",
